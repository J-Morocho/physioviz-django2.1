PhysioViz Notes
------------------

- Data files are in WFDB format

- There are two records per subject
    1. One contains Accelerometer, Temperature, and EDA signals
	- I will only focus on temperature data and maybe on EDA signal.
	- Multiple factors alter EDA
    2. The other contains Sp02 and HR signals.

- Header files contain information about the subject
- One annotation file per subject indicating time locations and labels of transition states.
- subjectinfo.csv also contains information about each subject.

.dat files are binary signal files.
.hea are short text header files. Used to read signal files and determinge location and format.
.atr binary files containing lables that point to specific times of occurence in ECG signals
