What is the goal of the project?

The idea is to create a dynamic(hopefully) visualization of a non-EEG dataset through django.

What functionality will it have?

The user will be presented with the data of subject 1. 
User will be able to click a play button to have the metrics play out over time.
The user can then choose another subject's data to look at by using a drop down menu.
The HR will be displayed as large numbers.
